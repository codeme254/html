# HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  
IT is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
> A markup language is a text-encoding system which specifies the structure and formatting of a document and even relationship among parts.  

HTML is used to describe the structure and content of web pages.  
HTML alone may not be too powerful and is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages like JavaScript and Pyscript.

## [Optional] - a brief history on HTML
Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), invented HTML in 1989. He aimed to create a system for sharing documents and information over the Internet.  
In 1991, Berners-Lee published the first version of HTML, called HTML 1.0. It had a simple structure with a limited set of elements, including headings, paragraphs, and links.  
As the web grew, so did the need for more features. HTML 2.0 was released in 1995, standardizing the tags and elements introduced in the first version and adding new ones like forms.  
HTML 3.2 was introduced in 1997 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), including new tags for tables, scripting, and improved presentation features like fonts and colors.  
HTML 4.0 (1997) and HTML 4.01 (1999) marked a significant step toward web standards. These versions introduced CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for better control over the presentation and supported multimedia elements like images and audio.  
In 2000, W3C introduced XHTML 1.0, a stricter version of HTML based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language). It enforced cleaner and more consistent coding practices, though it was not widely adopted due to its complexity.  
The development of HTML5 began in 2008 as a response to the limitations of previous versions, particularly XHTML. It was officially released in 2014 and remains the current standard.

## Modern HTML
HTML continues to evolve, with ongoing updates to support the latest web technologies. It is maintained by the W3C and WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group), focusing on improving performance, accessibility, and user experience on the web.
