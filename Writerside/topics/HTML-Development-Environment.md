# HTML Development Environment

To start writing HTML, all you need is a code editor and a web browser.  

## Code Editors
A code editor is a specialized software application for writing and editing code.  
It provides an environment where developers can create, modify, and manage code in various programming languages.  

Hereâ€™s a list of popular code editors that we can use to write HTML, each with a link to their download page:
- Visual Studio Code (Recommended) - [Link to download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

There are a lot of options when it comes to code editors that we can use to write HTML, however, I highly recommend that you go with Visual Studio Code.

## Web Browser
A web browser is a software application that allows users to access, retrieve, and view content on the World Wide Web.  
It acts as an interface between the user and the web, interpreting and displaying web pages written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies.  

Here is a list of web browsers that we can use in our HTML development:
- Microsoft Edge (Recommended) - [Link to download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download)

There are a lot of options when it comes to web browsers, any web browser you can think of can be used for HTML development, I highly recommend that you go with Microsoft Edge.
