# HTML tags and their anatomy
HTML tags are the building block of HTML, they are used to define the structure and content of a web page.  

## Anatomy of HTML tags
HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets ```< >``` and typically come in pairs (an opening tag and a closing tag).  
The opening tag indicates the beginning of an element, while the closing tag, which includes a forward slash ```/``` indicates the end of an element.  

```HTML
<tagname>some content</tagname>
```

- Opening tag - ```<tagname>```
- Content - ```some content```
- Closing tag - ```</tagname>```

Some tags are self-closing, meaning they don't require a closing tag, in this case, they appear as shown below.  
```HTML
<self-closing-tag />
```

## HTML Element
An HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag. Below for example is an ```HTML paragraph element```.  
```HTML
<p>Hello, World</p>
```
